<h1> BeffsBrowser changelog </h1>

<p>This is one of the improvement filled updates I love to release every so often with small fixes and major fixes. </p>

Important information concerning BeffsFilterBrowser Beta!
-BeffsFilterBrowser will be discontinued as a feature in BeffsBrowser as it has matured to a independent project. 
-The outlook on the retirement and removal of this feature is still to be determined and information will be announced as it becomes available. 

The independent project features a lot more features, some aren't even in the version featured in BeffsBrowser. 
</p>
